# Accounting frontend
Simple frontend for an accounting application, built using the React framework Next.js.

### Technologies
- Next.js 13 (React)
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS

### What can it do?
The application is modeled on an old PHP project, that I wrote to keep track of the expenses involved with restoring my sailboat. It keeps track of expenses, projects, and merchants.

### Why did I make this frontend?
In an attempt to learn Python and React I started working on this version. The frontend is the React side of that attempt. Check out my other repository [accounting-api](https://github.com/FrederikNorlyk/accounting-api) which covers the Python part.

### Try it out!
In a terminal navigate to the source code and run the following commands
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
The frontend does not work without a backend so you will also need to deploy the above-mentioned API.
